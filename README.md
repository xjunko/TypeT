bare bones osu! storyboard player.

### why make
friend of mine kept asking me cpp stuff, so you know what, instead of making false claims, <br/>
lets just the learn the language, might as well make a storyboard player while im at it.

### result
the result, it's finished.

https://github.com/xjunko/TypeT/assets/44401509/c071f42c-6bd0-4a8a-9da4-333f758dc726

it doesnt support the full-spec of storyboard (loops, trigger) but who cares.
